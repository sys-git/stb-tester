.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
stbt record [options]
.sp
stbt run [options] [script]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBstbt record\fP will record a test case by listening for remote\-control
keypresses, taking screenshots from the set\-top box as it goes.
.sp
You then (manually) crop the screenshots to the region of interest.
.sp
(Optionally) you manually edit the generated test script, which will look
something like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
press("MENU")
wait_for_match("Guide.png")
press("OK")
wait_for_match("BBC One.png")
.ft P
.fi
.sp
\fBstbt run\fP will play back the given test script, returning an exit status of
success or failure for easy integration with your existing test reporting
system.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS Global options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-control\fB= <uri>
A remote control to use for controlling the set top box. \fIuri\fP can be:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B lirc:<lircd_socket>:<remote_control_name>
A hardware infrared emitter controlled by the lirc (Linux Infrared Remote
Control) daemon. \fIlircd_socket\fP defaults to \fI/var/run/lirc/lircd\fP.
\fIremote_control_name\fP is the name of a remote\-control specification in
lircd.conf.
.TP
.B vr:<hostname>:<port>
A "virtual remote" that communicates with the set\-top box over TCP.
Requires a virtual remote listener (which we haven\(aqt released yet) running
on the stb.
.TP
.B none
Ignores key press commands.
.TP
.B test
Used by the selftests to change the input video stream. Only works with
\fI\-\-source\-pipeline=videotestsrc\fP. A script like \fIpress("18")\fP will change
videotestsrc\(aqs pattern property (see \fIgst\-inspect videotestsrc\fP).
.UNINDENT
.TP
.BI \-\-source\-pipeline\fB= <pipeline>
A gstreamer pipeline providing a video stream to use as video output from the
set\-top box under test.  For the Hauppauge HD PVR use:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! mpegtsdemux ! video/x\-h264 ! decodebin2
.ft P
.fi
.TP
.BI \-\-sink\-pipeline\fB= <pipeline>
A gstreamer pipeline to use for video output, like \fIxvimagesink\fP.
.TP
.B \-v,  \-\-verbose
Enable debug output.
.sp
With \fIstbt run\fP, specify \fI\-v\fP twice to enable GStreamer element dumps to
\fI./stbt\-debug\fP directory. Note that this will dump a \fIlot\fP of files \-\-
several images per frame processed. To group the images by frame, sort the
files by timestamp. This is intended for debugging the GStreamer elements; it
isn\(aqt intended for end users.
.UNINDENT
.SS Additional options to stbt record
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-control\-recorder\fB= <uri>
The source of remote control presses.  \fIuri\fP can be:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B lirc:<lircd_socket>:<remote_control_name>
A hardware infrared receiver controlled by the lirc (Linux Infrared Remote
Control) daemon. \fIlircd_socket\fP and \fIremote_control_name\fP are as for
\fI\-\-control\fP.
.TP
.B vr:<hostname>:<port>
Listens on the socket <hostname>:<port> for a connection and reads a
"virtual remote" stream (which we haven\(aqt documented yet, but we\(aqll
probably change it soon to be compatible with LIRC\(aqs protocol).
.TP
.B \fI\%file:/\fP/<filename>
Reads remote control keypresses from a newline\-separated list of key names.
For example, \fIfile:///dev/stdin\fP to use the keyboard as the remote control
input.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.BI \-o \ <filename>, \ \-\-output\-filename\fB= <filename>
The file to write the generated test script to.
.UNINDENT
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
All parameters that can be passed to the stbt tools can also be specified in
configuration files. Configuration is searched for in the following files (with
later files taking precedence):
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
/etc/stbt/stbt.conf
.IP 2. 3
~/.config/stbt/stbt.conf
.IP 3. 3
$STBT_CONFIG_FILE
.UNINDENT
.sp
These files are simple ini files with the form:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[global]
    source_pipeline=videotestsrc
    control=None
[run]
    script=test.py
[record]
    output_file=test.py
    control_recorder=file:///dev/stdin
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Each key corresponds to a command line option with hyphens replaced with
underscores.  Configuration items in the \(aqglobal\(aq section will be passed to
all tools; this can be overridden in the sections corresponding to each of the
individual tools.
.SH HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
.sp
The test rig consists of a Linux server, with:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A video\-capture card (for capturing the output from the system under test)
.IP \(bu 2
An infrared receiver (for recording test cases)
.IP \(bu 2
An infrared emitter (for controlling the system under test)
.UNINDENT
.SS Video capture card
.sp
You\(aqll need a capture card with drivers supporting the V4L2 API
(Video\-for\-Linux 2). We recommend a capture card with mature open\-source
drivers, preferably drivers already present in recent versions of the Linux
kernel.
.sp
The Hauppauge HD PVR works well (and works out of the box on recent versions of
Fedora), though it doesn\(aqt support 1080p. If you need an HDCP stripper, try the
HD Fury III.
.SS Infra\-red emitter and receiver
.sp
An IR emitter+receiver such as the RedRat3, plus a LIRC configuration file
with the key codes for your set\-top box\(aqs remote control.
.SS Using software components instead
.sp
If you don\(aqt mind instrumenting the system under test, you don\(aqt even need the
above hardware components.
.sp
stb\-tester uses gstreamer, an open source multimedia framework. Instead of a
video\-capture card you can use any gstreamer video\-source element. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If you run tests against a VM running the set\-top box software instead
of a physical set\-top box, you could use the ximagesrc gstreamer
element to capture video from the VM\(aqs X Window.
.IP \(bu 2
If your set\-top box uses DirectFB, you could install the (not yet written)
DirectFBSource gstreamer element on the set\-top box to stream video to a
tcpclientsrc or tcpserversrc gstreamer element on the test rig.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Instead of a hardware infra\-red receiver + emitter, you can use a software
equivalent (for example a server running on the set\-top box that listens on
a TCP socket instead of listening for infra\-red signals, and your own
application for emulating remote\-control keypresses). Using a software remote
control avoids all issues of IR interference in rigs testing multiple set\-top
boxes at once.
.SS Linux server
.sp
An 8\-core machine will be able to drive 4 set\-top boxes simultaneously with at
least 1 frame per second per set\-top box. (Note that \fIstbt\fP currently doesn\(aqt
support multiple infra\-red emitters on the same PC, but this is relatively
trivial to fix and will be addressed in the near future.)
.SH SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A Unixy operating system (we have only tested on Linux; gstreamer and OpenCV
allegedly work on BSD, Mac OS X, and possibly Windows with MingW/MSys).
.IP \(bu 2
Drivers for any required hardware components
.IP \(bu 2
gstreamer 0.10 (multimedia framework) + gst\-plugins\-base + gst\-plugins\-good.
.IP \(bu 2
python (we have tested with 2.6 and 2.7) + pygst + pygtk2 (+ nose for the
self\-tests).
.IP \(bu 2
OpenCV (image processing library) version >= 2.0.0.
.IP \(bu 2
For the Hauppauge video capture device you\(aqll need the gstreamer\-ffmpeg
package (e.g. from the rpmfusion\-free repository) for H.264 decoding.
.UNINDENT
.SH INSTALLING FROM SOURCE
.sp
Run "make install" from the stb\-tester source directory.
.sp
Requires python\-docutils (for building the documentation).
.SH SETUP TIPS
.sp
Use "gst\-inspect stbt\-templatematch" to check that gstreamer can find the
templatematch element. You may need to set GST_PLUGIN_PATH to point
where you installed libgst\-stb\-tester.so.
.sp
Run tests/run\-tests.sh to verify that your gstreamer + OpenCV installation is
working correctly.
.sp
If you plan to use real infrared emitters/receivers, use lirc\(aqs irsend(1) and
ircat(1), respectively, to test your lirc setup before integrating with
stb\-tester.
.SH TEST SCRIPT FORMAT
.sp
The test scripts produced and run by \fBstbt record\fP and \fBstbt run\fP,
respectively, are actually python scripts, so you can use the full power of
python. Don\(aqt get too carried away, though; aim for simplicity, readability,
and maintainability.
.sp
The following functions are available:
.\" <start python docs>
.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B press(key)
Send the specified key\-press to the system under test.
.sp
The mechanism used to send the key\-press depends on what you\(aqve configured
with \fI\-\-control\fP.
.sp
\fIkey\fP is a string. The allowed values depend on the control you\(aqre using:
If that\(aqs lirc, then \fIkey\fP is a key name from your lirc config file.
.TP
.B wait_for_match(image, timeout_secs=10, consecutive_matches=1, noise_threshold=0.16)
Search for \fIimage\fP in the source video stream.
.sp
Raises \fIMatchTimeout\fP if no match is found after \fItimeout_secs\fP seconds.
.sp
\fIconsecutive_matches\fP forces this function to wait for several consecutive
frames with a match found at the same x,y position.
.sp
Increase \fInoise_threshold\fP to avoid false negatives, at the risk of
increasing false positives (a value of 1.0 will report a match every time);
increase \fIconsecutive_matches\fP to avoid false positives due to noise. But
please let us know if you are having trouble with image matches, so that we
can improve the matching algorithm.
.TP
.B press_until_match(key, image, interval_secs=3, noise_threshold=0.16, max_presses=10)
Calls \fIpress\fP as many times as necessary to find the specified \fIimage\fP.
.sp
Raises \fIMatchTimeout\fP if no match is found after \fImax_presses\fP times.
.sp
\fIinterval_secs\fP is the number of seconds to wait for a match before
pressing again.
.TP
.B wait_for_motion(timeout_secs=10, consecutive_frames=10, mask=None)
Search for motion in the source video stream.
.sp
Raises \fIMotionTimeout\fP if no motion is detected after \fItimeout_secs\fP
seconds.
.sp
Considers the video stream to have motion if there were differences between
10 consecutive frames (or the number specified with \fIconsecutive_frames\fP).
.sp
\fImask\fP is a black and white image that specifies which part of the image
to search for motion. White pixels select the area to search; black pixels
the area to ignore.
.TP
.B detect_match(image, timeout_secs=10, noise_threshold=0.16)
Generator that yields a sequence of one \fIMatchResult\fP for each frame in
the source video stream.
.sp
Returns after \fItimeout_secs\fP seconds. (Note that the caller can also choose
to stop iterating over this function\(aqs results at any time.)
.sp
\fInoise_threshold\fP is a parameter used by the templatematch algorithm.
Increase \fInoise_threshold\fP to avoid false negatives, at the risk of
increasing false positives (a value of 1.0 will report a match every time).
.TP
.B detect_motion(timeout_secs=10, mask=None)
Generator that yields a sequence of one \fIMotionResult\fP for each frame
in the source video stream.
.sp
Returns after \fItimeout_secs\fP seconds. (Note that the caller can also choose
to stop iterating over this function\(aqs results at any time.)
.sp
\fImask\fP is a black and white image that specifies which part of the image
to search for motion. White pixels select the area to search; black pixels
the area to ignore.

.SH TEST SCRIPT BEST PRACTICES
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
When cropping images to be matched by a test case, you must select a region
that will \fInot\fP be present when the test case fails, and that does \fInot\fP
contain \fIany\fP elements that might be absent when the test case succeeds. For
example, you must not include any part of a live TV stream (which will be
different each time the test case is run), nor translucent menu overlays with
live TV showing through.
.IP \(bu 2
Don\(aqt crop tiny images: Instead of selecting just the text in a menu button,
select the whole button. (Larger images provide a greater gap between the
"match certainty" reported for non\-matching vs. matching images, which makes
for more robust tests).
